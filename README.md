## What is vxlang?

**VXLANG** is a project designed to prevent reverse-engineering behaviors such as static or dynamic analysis, file tampering, and unauthorized access to memory by attackers. 

The vxlang project currently targets x86-64 system and .Net binaries, native binary files for the Microsoft Windows operating system, including executables with the ".exe" extension, dynamic link library files with the ".dll" extension, and kernel driver files with the ".sys" extension. (The types of target binaries supported by vxlang will be expanded in future updates).

## Precautions

- `Optimization` : Verify that VxVirtualizationBegin and VxVirtualizationEnd are in the same block.  
  If procedures are merged due to code optimization, problems may arise.
- `switch-case` : In the switch-case, when the branch movement is not an IMM value, it may be moved to the original position.
- `Exception handling` : Currently, the virtual CPU does not support exception handling.
