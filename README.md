## What is vxlang?

**VXLANG** is a project designed to prevent reverse-engineering behaviors such as static or dynamic analysis, file tampering, and unauthorized access to memory by attackers. 

The vxlang project currently targets x86-64 system and .Net binaries, native binary files for the Microsoft Windows operating system, including executables with the ".exe" extension, dynamic link library files with the ".dll" extension, and kernel driver files with the ".sys" extension. (The types of target binaries supported by vxlang will be expanded in future updates).

## Precautions

- `Optimization` : Verify that VxVirtualizationBegin and VxVirtualizationEnd are in the same block.  
  If procedures are merged due to code optimization, problems may arise.
- `switch-case` : In the switch-case, when the branch movement is not an IMM value, it may be moved to the original position.
- `Exception handling` : Currently, the virtual CPU does not support exception handling.

## Latest Version

- [Download](https://vxlang.github.io/download.html)
  - Demo: ver.1.2.1.0
  - Full: Latest version
 
1.0.0
---
- `1.2.3.0`
  - [ALL] Fixed to support SDK for patterns (see plt/got) referencing libraries in clang or gcc.
  - [Packer] Outputs an error message if the library or function cannot be referenced during the image loading process.
- `1.2.2.0`
  - [Virtualizer] A new-virtual machine(v3-core) has been added. The new virtual machine will be used with older versions of the virtual machine(v2-core) after being tested in version 1.2.2.0. Virtual machine types will continue to be added in the future.
  - [Obfuscator] The node-difficulty for code flattening is improved, which reduces the overall code size.
  - [Packer] As a user request, I have re-activated the feature for add-on.
- `1.2.1.1`
  - [Obfuscator] Add obfuscation pattern.
- `1.2.1.0`
  - [Packer] Fixed .NET-related bugs.
  - [Packer] Packer add-on modules are no longer supported.
  - [Obfuscator] Default code obfuscation has been added again.
  - The default obfuscation pattern will be updated every version :)

## TODO
- `Task`
  - Add ELF32/64 format for x86-64
  - Add code obfuscation methods for x86-64
    - Once the above steps are complete, add the ARM system for the ELF file format.
